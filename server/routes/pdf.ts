Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. They are fundamental concepts in computer science and are essential for efficient algorithm design.

Basic Data Structures:

1. Arrays
Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations. They provide constant-time access to elements using indices but have fixed size in most implementations.

2. Linked Lists
Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. They allow dynamic size but require sequential access.

3. Stacks
Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They are used in function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

4. Queues
Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. They are essential for breadth-first search, scheduling, and buffering.

5. Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Binary trees, AVL trees, and B-trees are common variants.

6. Graphs
Graphs consist of vertices connected by edges. They can be directed or undirected and are used to model relationships and networks.

Applications:
- Database indexing
- Memory management
- Network routing
- Compiler design
- Game development

Time Complexity:
Understanding Big O notation is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of operations on different data structures.
